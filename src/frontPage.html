			<p>i am an aspiring software engineer from atlanta, ga. currently, i attend george washington university in washington
			d.c. where i am pursuing a bachelor of science in computer science.
			<br><br>
			i started my journey in cs in highschool, taking both ap cs courses. although these classes urked my curiosity in cs, i'd
			end up taking a long-winded break from cs upon completion. i was headed down the road to become a lawyer, and i had 
			initially started my education at george washington as a political science major. my second semester, i decided i wanted
			to take up a minor and i chose cs since i remember enjoying it in high school and always had a natural interest in computers
			(because video games). this is where my passion for cs was reinvigorated, as i took calculus 1 and introduction to software
			development which i ended up loving. by the following summer, i was certain i had way more passion for cs and decide to 
			make a complete switch. i then spent the summer developing a game in java, as games are what initially inspired my eagerness
			in technology and java was the only language i knew. i ported the game over to mobile using codename one and by the end of 
			the summer, my first personal project was completed. my second personal project was a website made in a hackathon during 
			my first semester as a sophmore. it aimed to track the validity of our dining hall's ice cream machine. with the limited
			time-constraint of a hackathon, i hastily put together some html and css pages. to further develop these skills, i am now here,
			developing my 3rd project, which is this personal website. i want to also learn the javascript that goes into developing a site,
			as well as pickup backend skills.

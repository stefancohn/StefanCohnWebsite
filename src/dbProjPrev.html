	<p>Can't reveal code due to academic integrity. Here is a preview. <br> <br>
	This website features the ability for a prospective graduate student to apply for this grad school. <br>
	The application gets reviewed by faculty before being finally approved. This application was integrated with <br>
	two other applications to create a full-fledged portal for graduate students. Thus, this website required <br>
	tons of backend development as well as front end development. The backend was constructed with Flask. <br>
	The database was created with SQL. This was all done for my Databases Design Class. What you see here was <br>
	created with 2 other people over the course of a couple of weeks. </p>

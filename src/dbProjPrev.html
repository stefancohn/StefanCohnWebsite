	<p>Can't reveal code due to academic integrity. Here is a preview. <br> <br>
	This website features the ability for a prospective graduate student to apply for this grad school. <br>
	The application gets reviewed by faculty before being finally approved. This application was integrated with <br>
	two other applications to create a full-fledged portal for graduate students. Thus, this website required <br>
	tons of backend development as well as front end development. The backend was constructed with Flask. <br>
	The database was created with SQL. This was all done for my Databases Design Class. What you see here was <br>
	created with 2 other people over the course of a couple of weeks. <br> <br>
	To delve in to the site from a more technical point, it allows a user to fill out an application - this application includes <br>
	uploading files (like transcript), emailing the "university", and even includes an automated mailer. <br>
	All the data in the application gets appropriately parsed and stored into the SQL DB. Along with filling out <br>
	an application, users have to make an account to go along with it. There are also faculty accounts with different roles.
	<br> These roles include judging applications, accepting transcripts, viewing reccomendation letters, and accepting applicants. <br>
	There is a centralized faculty page for reviewing applications and depending on the certain role, thanks to Flask, the appropriate features <br>
	get shown on to the page. The creation of this application <br> After integrating the site with another webpage that allows users to 
	register for classes, get grades, etc. I had to add a feature to matriculate applicants from applicant to student. <br>
	Also created a "main" portal page for faculty and students which shows the approrpiate content based on the "role".</p>
